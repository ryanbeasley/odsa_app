# Orlando DSA App – User & Admin Guide

This document covers the primary flows for regular members and administrators.

## Member Experience

### 1. Sign in / Sign up
- Launch the app to see the chapter hero screen.
- Enter your email/password to log in.
- Tap “Need an account? Sign up” to create a profile.
- Optional: choose “Continue with Google” for OAuth login.

### 2. Home
- After logging in, the dashboard greets you by email prefix and shows your role (Member).
- The “Navigate the app” section lists quick links: Announcements, Events, Working Groups, Support, Settings. Tap any tile to jump there.

### 3. Announcements
- Scroll through the latest posts; more load automatically as you reach the end.
- Inline links (including event deep links) open inside the app.
- Compose tools are hidden unless you’re an admin.

### 4. Events
- Use the search bar, “Events I’m attending” toggle, and “Working group” filter to find relevant events.
- Tap “Attend” to RSVP, “Attending” to cancel. For recurring series you can apply the action to a single event or the series.
- Event cards show recurrence info and a preview of upcoming occurrences.

### 5. Working Groups
- Browse descriptions, members, and created dates. Members view-only.

### 6. Support
- Access curated links (contact organizers, national DSA resources, etc.). Tap to open in your browser.

### 7. Settings
- **Account overview**: shows email and profile details.
- **Update user information**: edit first/last name, phone, alternate email.
- **Notifications**: toggle push alerts for announcements and event reminders.
- **Session**: log out when you’re done organizing on the device.

## Admin Experience
Admins see everything members do plus additional tools.

### 1. Admin view toggle
- Settings → “Switch view” lets you flip between admin tools and a member preview. The badge indicates your current mode.

### 2. Announcements (compose)
- Admins see the draft field, an “Add link” button for `[text](url)` markup, and a “Save announcement” button that triggers push notifications for opted-in members.

### 3. Events (manage)
- “Add event” opens the full event editor (working group, location, start/end, recurrence, monthly pattern).
- Edit/delete buttons appear on each event card. Deleting prompts whether to remove just that occurrence or the entire series.
- “Copy link” creates shareable deep links (single event or entire series) for announcements, DMs, etc.

### 4. Working Groups
- Admin panel allows creating, editing, and deleting groups. Deleting cascades to associated events.

### 5. Support Links
- Inside the Support screen, admins get chips to reorder (“Up/Down”), edit, remove, or add new links (title/description/link).

### 6. User Management
- Settings → Users lists all members. Filter by email/name. Use the checkbox to promote/demote users (you cannot demote yourself).

### 7. Notifications
- Admins can manage their own push preferences just like members. Enabling “Event alerts” ensures they receive day-of and hour-before reminders for events they attend.

## Tips for Both Roles
- **Deep Links:** Copy an event link (from the copy button in Events) and paste it in announcements or chats; tapping it opens that event or series directly inside the app.
- **Push Opt-In:** Members must enable notifications in Settings → Notifications to receive announcement or event pushes.
- **Logging Out:** Use Settings → Session → “Log out” when switching devices, especially shared phones.

This quick reference should help you navigate the mobile or web build whether you’re a member browsing updates or an admin managing the chapter’s schedule.
