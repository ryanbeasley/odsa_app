# Orlando DSA App Privacy Policy
_Effective: April 13, 2025_

The Orlando Democratic Socialists of America (“Orlando DSA,” “we,” “our”) created the Orlando DSA mobile application (“the App”) to help members stay informed about chapter announcements, events, and working groups. This policy explains what personal information we collect through the App, how we use it, and the choices available to you.

## Information We Collect

We collect the following information when you use the App:

- **Account Information**: Email address, password, and any optional profile details you provide (first name, last name, phone number).
- **Usage Information**: Event attendance selections, working group submissions, and announcements you create if you are an administrator.
- **Device Identifiers**: Push notification tokens generated by your device if you opt in to announcements or event reminders.

We do **not** collect GPS/location data, payment information, or access your contacts/photos.

## How We Use Information

We use your information to:

1. Authenticate your account and authorize access to member-only features.
2. Display events, announcements, and working groups relevant to Orlando DSA.
3. Send optional push notifications when new announcements are posted or when events you are attending are approaching.
4. Help organizers understand aggregate participation (e.g., attendance counts) to plan future actions.

We do not sell your data or share it with advertisers.

## Sharing & Disclosure

- **Organizers**: Chapter admins can view member profiles and attendance to coordinate events and working group activity.
- **Service Providers**: We use trusted infrastructure providers (e.g., Google Cloud) to host the API and database. These providers do not have permission to use your data for their own purposes.
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect the safety of members.

## Data Security

We use industry-standard safeguards (encrypted connections, password hashing) to protect your information. Despite our efforts, no system can be completely secure; please use strong passwords and keep your devices updated.

## Your Choices

- **Profile Updates**: You can edit your profile information from the Settings screen.
- **Notifications**: You can enable/disable push notifications for announcements and events in Settings. You can also disable notifications in your device’s system settings.
- **Account Deletion**: To delete your account or request a data export, email privacy@orlandodsa.org and we will respond within 30 days.

## Children’s Privacy

The App is intended for adult members of Orlando DSA. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe a child provided us with personal information, contact us at privacy@orlandodsa.org so we can remove it.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the App or by email. Your continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance.
